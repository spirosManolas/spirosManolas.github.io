  abstract     = {Lagrangian and Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) hydrodynamics codes such as FLAG form the backbone of many mission-critical multiphysics simulations at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Critical to performing high fidelity simulations with these codes are Lagrangian and ALE contact algorithms, which allow materials to collide, slide, and separate throughout a simulation. Current lagrangian and ALE contact algorithms do not have the ability to track individual material velocities across sub-zonal material interfaces, which is essential to integrating contact and sliding with a diverse range of multiphysics capabilities. We develop such an ALE contact algorithm which has the capability to operate on sub-zonal material interfaces and on one simply connected mesh in a single dimension. This is performed by evolving each material within a lagrangian mesh individually, and then correcting the position of each material with a contact force, calculated using the overfill between materials, so that polygonal and nodal positions align with that of a single-velocity mesh. An optional first-order remapping procedure to a universal mesh may then be used so that void may be removed or injected from a cell. Our algorithm is tested on a variety of one-dimensional test cases, and is able to converge to analytical solutions when available, as well as conserve total energy. Future work involves extending our results to two and three dimensions, implementing a higher order remapping procedure, and implementing the algorithm in FLAG.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing images from noisy and indirect measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem critical for many medical and geophysical imaging applications. Optimizing the experiment design through slight improvements in the information content or small reductions in the measurement costs is beneficial in many applications. As such, optimizing the measurement process by finding the best measurements is often desirable, though this presents a difficult and intractable problem. As a possible approach, this project investigates the potential of a conditional continuous normalizing flow (CCNF) and learned binary mask model to reconstruct images from noisy, indirect, and optimized measurements. We simulated the process of taking noisy and indirect measurements using the MNIST dataset as a proxy for MRI brain scans due to the comparatively small image sizes of the MNIST dataset.  The measurement optimization was performed by applying a learned binary mask to the images. Our model approach used CCNF, in conjunction with an encoder/decoder framework, to reconstruct the original images in the data space and by processing the noisy measurements and conditionals (original quality images) from the latent space. The model produced semi-legible reconstructed images, indicating that while the approach holds potential, the results also highlighted the need for further refinement of the model to improve the quality of image reconstructions.},
