Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am an aspiring computational scientist with research interests primarily in the development of computational and  numerical methods and with applications in the simulation of physical systems and topology optimization. 

I am in the third year of my undergraduate degree at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in Applied and Pure Mathematics with a minor in Mechanical Engineering as a [Simons STEM Scholar](https://www.stonybrook.edu/simonsscholars/). I am currently working under Dr. Shikui Chen in the [Computational Modeling Analysis Design and Optimization (CMADO) Laboratory](http://me.eng.stonybrook.edu/~chen/), where my work focuses on designing bi-stable brain aneurysm implants through the development of a novel dual conformal geometry and non-linear topology optimization algorithm.

Previously, I've worked with [Los Alamos National Laboratory's X-Computational Physics (XCP) Division](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/xcp) under Dr. Nathaniel Vaughn-Kukura and Dr. Mikhail Shashkov; I participated in the [Emory University REU on Computational Mathematics for Data Science](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/cmds-reuret/projects/2024-oed/) where I was mentored by Dr. Nicole Yang; and I also used to conduct research under [Dr. Hyun-Kyung Lim](https://www.ams.stonybrook.edu/~hyulim/) where I explored quantum error mitigation for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

In the summer of 2025, I conducted research at [Los Alamos National Laboratory's X-Computational Physics (XCP) Division](https://www.lanl.gov/engage/organizations/xcp) under the mentorship of Dr. Nathaniel Vaughn-Kukura and Dr. Mikhail Shashkov, where I worked on developing multi-velocity capabilities for arbitrary lagrangian eulerian contact algorithms. I have previously worked with [Dr. Hyun-Kyung Lim](https://www.ams.stonybrook.edu/~hyulim/), under whom I explored projects relating to investigating quantum error mitigation for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and parallelization for quantitative finance. In the summer of 2024, under the mentorship of Dr. Nicole Yang, I participated in the [Emory University REU on Computational Mathematics for Data Science](https://www.math.emory.edu/site/cmds-reuret/projects/2024-oed/) where I completed a project on optimal experiment design and image reconstruction using generative methods with applications in medical imaging. In the winter of 2025, I participated in a research abroad experience at the [Turkana Basin Institute (TBI)](https://www.turkanabasin.org/) in Kenya, where I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the scientific process, sustainability efforts, and the importance of interdisciplinary research in addressing global challenges.

Beyond my research, I am committed to making a positive impact on my community. I currently volunteer with the [Sustainable Horizons Institute (SHI)](https://shinstitute.org/) , where I assist in the creation of "CULTIVATE Conversations," a series of online zoom talks and webinars for researchers of all levels with interests in STEM / the Computational Sciences, with the aim of building diverse and inclusive communities within the computational sciences. I also enjoy mentoring through my University's [College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Peer Mentoring Program](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ceas-undergrad/current_students/peer_mentoring_program/) and the Simons STEM Scholars Program, as well as teaching as an undergraduate teaching assistant (Fall 2025: SSP 380 Research and Discovery in STEM - Spring 2025: AMS 361 Applied Calculus III) and as a [Tutor](https://westpalmtestprep.com/). Additionally, I serve as the president of my university's [Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Student Chapter](https://siamsc-sbu.github.io/), a Cohort Representative for the Simons STEM Scholars student government, and a Public Relations Officer for my university's [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Student Chapter](https://sites.google.com/view/aiaa-sbu/home).

I enjoy using my free time on various hobbies, such as hiking, bike riding, cooking/baking, trying new foods, listening to music, learning origami, and spending time with loved ones!
